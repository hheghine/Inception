## Introduction

The goal of the project is to containerize a simple web application infrastructure using Docker Compose.

The project involves setting up three mandatory containers - a `MariaDB` database, an `NGINX` web server, and a `WordPress` instance and several optional bonus services as an additional challenge:

- `Redis` - Caching service for WordPress to improve performance
- `FTP Server` - To enable file transfers to the WordPress container
- `Static Website` - A simple HTML/CSS site running behind a NodeJS container
- `Adminer` - Database management tool for MariaDB
- `Uptime Kuma` - Container monitoring solution to track services
